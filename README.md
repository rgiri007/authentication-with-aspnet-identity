# [Authentication With ASP.NET Identity][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]



User authentication and authorization are mandatory components of nearly every web application. You could always roll your own solution, but that's not considered best practice. It is too easy to introduce a security flaw into your system that could lead to compromised user data. Instead, it's better to use a robust existing authentication and authorization library.

This course will show you how to use Microsoft's Identity frameworkâ€”a complete user authentication and authorization system for ASP.NET applications.
